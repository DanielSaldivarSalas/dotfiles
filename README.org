* What are dotfiles?
Dotfiles is where you keep your crafted configuration.

- Text-based configuration files for programs to use
- Personal scripts
- Called "dotfiles" because the file or directory starts with a "."


On Linux and macOS there are certain dotfiles you will commonly see:
- ~~/.bash_profile~ - a script loaded when you log in
- ~~/.bashrc~ - a script loaded when you open a terminal
- ~~/.emacs.d/~ - Emacs configuration
- ~~/.gitconfig~ - Configuration for git
- ~~/.config~ - A folder full of many more configuration files

  Many window programs will store the dot-configuration files in ~C:\Users\username~
